I just saw your email, and I’m struggling to find the right words. Receiving this news at such a late hour has been deeply unsettling, it took me some time to process the news of your resignation.

Though I had heard whispers about your departure, but seeing it confirmed is a hard pill to swallow, seeing it confirmed in your words makes it all the more real and, understandably, quite disheartening.

Your guidance has been a cornerstone in my professional development, particularly in refining my soft skills and interpersonal abilities. I cannot express enough how much your support and mentorship have meant to me. Your insights and encouragement have not only shaped my career but have also left a lasting impact on my personal growth. The skills and confidence I’ve gained under your guidance are invaluable, and I find myself at a loss as to how to move forward without your support.

As you embark on this new chapter, please know that your contributions have made a significant difference in my life and the lives of many others. While your departure leaves a void that will be very challenging to fill, Thank you for everything you’ve given to me and to us all. Your legacy will certainly live on in the skills and values you’ve instilled in those you’ve mentored.

I am confident that wherever you go, your new workspace will benefit immensely from your expertise and dedication, just as we have, Wishing you nothing but the best in this new chapter of your life.

Thank you once again for everything.
