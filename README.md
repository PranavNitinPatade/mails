To automatically delete data from Oracle SQL tables after a specific period, such as 6 months, you can use a combination of SQL features and scheduling tools. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive approach using Oracle Database features:

1. Using Oracle Database Triggers and Jobs
Option A: Using DBMS_SCHEDULER (Recommended)
Oracle's DBMS_SCHEDULER package allows you to schedule jobs to run at regular intervals. You can create a scheduled job to delete data older than 6 months from your tables.

Step 1: Create a PL/SQL Procedure to Delete Old Data

Write a PL/SQL procedure that performs the deletion. For example, if you have a table employees with a hire_date column:

sql
Copy code
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE delete_old_employees IS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM employees
    WHERE hire_date < ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -6);
    COMMIT;
END;
/
Step 2: Schedule the Job Using DBMS_SCHEDULER

Create a job to execute this procedure at regular intervals, e.g., daily.

sql
Copy code
BEGIN
    DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_job (
        job_name        => 'DELETE_OLD_EMPLOYEES_JOB',
        job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
        job_action      => 'BEGIN delete_old_employees; END;',
        start_date      => SYSTIMESTAMP,
        repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY; BYHOUR=0; BYMINUTE=0; BYSECOND=0',
        enabled         => TRUE
    );
END;
